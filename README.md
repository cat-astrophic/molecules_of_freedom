## Description

This repo contains the data and code for "Molecules of Inefficiency: How tariffs impact carbon intensities, carbon dioxide emissions, and the environment" which has been accepted for publication at *Science of the Total Environment*. The data is located in the compressed folder Data.zip. The Python script MoI.py runs statistical analyses (including the spatial econometric models), creates six choropleth maps, and creates two time series plots, all of which are included in the paper. Also included is the script W.py is a generic file I use for manually created spatial weights matrices.
